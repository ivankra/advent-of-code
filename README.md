# Advent of Code

Personal solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems.

  * `YYYY/NN/` directory for each problem NN from year YYYY
  * `p.ext` solution to both parts, or `p1.ext` / `p2.ext` for part1 / part2
  * Input is normally from stdin
  * `Makefile` to build and run solutions on `input.txt` (maybe be missing in trivial cases like `./p.py <input.txt`)
